This fact will be more explicitly explained in the text of this work. Śrī Vyāsadeva asserts herein that Śrī Kṛṣṇa is the original Personality of Godhead, and all others are His direct or indirect plenary portions or portions of the portion. Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī has even more explicitly explained the subject matter in his <i>Kṛṣṇa-sandarbha.</i> And Brahmā, the original living being, has explained the subject of Śrī Kṛṣṇa substantially in his treatise named <i>Brahma-saṁhitā.</i> In an <i>Upaniṣad</i> in the <i>Sāma-veda,</i> it is also stated that Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa is the divine son of Devakī. Therefore, in this prayer, the first proposition holds that Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa is the primeval Lord, and if any transcendental nomenclature is to be understood as belonging to the Absolute Personality of Godhead, it must be the name indicated by the word Kṛṣṇa, which means the all-attractive. In <i><a href=\"https://vedabase.io/en/library/bg/\">Bhagavad-gītā</a>,</i> in many places, the Lord asserts Himself to be the original Personality of Godhead, and this is confirmed by Arjuna, and also by great sages like Nārada, Vyāsa, and many others. In the <i>Padma Purāṇa,</i> it is also stated that out of the innumerable names of the Lord, the name of Kṛṣṇa is the principal one. Vāsudeva indicates the plenary portion of the Personality of Godhead, and all the different forms of the Lord, being identical with Vāsudeva, are indicated in this text. The name Vāsudeva particularly indicates the divine son of Vasudeva and Devakī. Śrī Kṛṣṇa is always meditated upon by the <i>paramahaṁsas,</i> who are the perfected ones among those in the renounced order of life."

How this is so is explained in later chapters of this work. This work is described by Mahāprabhu Śrī Caitanya as the spotless <i>Purāṇa</i> because it contains the transcendental narration of the Personality of Godhead, Śrī Kṛṣṇa. The history of the <i><a href=\"https://vedabase.io/en/library/sb/\">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</a></i> is also very glorious. It was compiled by Śrī Vyāsadeva after he had attained maturity in transcendental knowledge. He wrote this under the instructions of Śrī Nāradajī, his spiritual master. Vyāsadeva compiled all Vedic literatures, containing the four divisions of the <i>Vedas,</i> the <i>Vedānta-sūtras</i> (or the <i>Brahma-sūtras</i>), the <i>Purāṇas,</i> the <i>Mahābhārata,</i> and so on. But nevertheless he was not satisfied. His dissatisfaction was observed by his spiritual master, and thus Nārada advised him to write on the transcendental activities of Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa. These transcendental activities are described specifically in the Tenth Canto of this work. But, in order to reach to the very substance, one must proceed gradually by developing knowledge of the categories. It is natural that a philosophical mind wants to know about the origin of the creation. At night he sees the stars in the sky, and he naturally speculates about their inhabitants. Such inquiries are natural for man because man has a developed consciousness which is higher than that of the animals. The author of <i><a href=\"https://vedabase.io/en/library/sb/\">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</a></i> gives a direct answer to such inquiries. He says that the Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa is the origin of all creations. He is not only the creator of the universe, but the destroyer as well. "

If a man’s brain can produce a space satellite, one can very easily imagine how brains higher than man can produce similarly wonderful things which are far superior. The reasonable person will easily accept this argument, but there are stubborn atheists who would never agree. Śrīla Vyāsadeva, however, at once accepts the supreme intelligence as the <i>parameśvara.</i> He offers his respectful obeisances unto the supreme intelligence addressed as the <i>para</i> or the <i>parameśvara</i> or the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

Śrīla Vyāsadeva therefore gives the reader the chance to gradually develop spiritual realization before actually relishing the essence of the pastimes of the Lord. Therefore, he purposely invokes a Gāyatrī <i>mantra, dhīmahi.</i> This Gāyatrī <i>mantra</i> is meant for spiritually advanced people.

In the desert mirage there is no actual water. There is only the appearance of water. Real water is somewhere else. The manifested cosmic creation appears as reality. But reality, of which this is but a shadow, is in the spiritual world. Absolute Truth is in the spiritual sky, not the material sky. In the material sky everything is relative truth. That is to say, one truth depends on something else. This cosmic creation results from interaction of the three modes of nature, and the temporary manifestations are so created as to present an illusion of reality to the bewildered mind of the conditioned soul, who appears in so many species of life, including the higher demigods, like Brahmā, Indra, Candra, and so on. In actuality, there is no reality in the manifested world. There appears to be reality, however, because of the true reality which exists in the spiritual world, where the Personality of Godhead eternally exists with His transcendental paraphernalia."

It is said that the source from which everything emanates at the beginning of Brahmā’s millennium, and the reservoir to which everything ultimately enters, is the Absolute Truth, or Brahman. Material scientists take it for granted that the ultimate source of the planetary system is the sun, but they are unable to explain the source of the sun. Herein, the ultimate source is explained. According to the Vedic literatures, Brahmā, who may be compared to the sun, is not the ultimate creator. It is stated in this <i>śloka</i> that Brahmā was taught Vedic knowledge by the Personality of Godhead. One may argue that Brahmā, being the original living being, could not be inspired because there was no other being living at that time. Herein it is stated that the Supreme Lord inspired the secondary creator, Brahmā, in order that Brahmā could carry out his creative functions. So, the supreme intelligence behind all creations is the Absolute Godhead, Śrī Kṛṣṇa.

No other living entity is either <i>abhijñaḥ</i> or <i>svarāṭ.</i> That is, no one is either fully cognizant or fully independent. Even Brahmā has to meditate upon the Supreme Lord in order to create. Then what to speak of great scientists like Einstein! The brains of such a scientist are certainly not the products of any human being. Scientists cannot manufacture such a brain, and what to speak of foolish atheists who defy the authority of the Lord? Even Māyāvādī impersonalists who flatter themselves that they can become one with the Lord are neither <i>abhijñaḥ</i> nor <i>svarāṭ.</i> Such impersonalists undergo severe austerities to acquire knowledge to become one with the Lord. But ultimately they become dependent on some rich disciple who supplies them with money to build monasteries and temples. Atheists like Rāvaṇa or Hiraṇyakaśipu had to undergo severe penances before they could flout the authority of the Lord. But ultimately, they were rendered helpless and could not save themselves when the Lord appeared before them as cruel death. This is also the case with the modern atheists who also dare to flout the authority of the Lord. Such atheists will be dealt with similarly, for history repeats itself. Whenever men neglect the authority of the Lord, nature and her laws are there to penalize them.

An atheist may argue that God is no more expert than a watchmaker, but of course God is greater because He can create machines in duplicate male and female forms. The male and female forms of different types of machineries go on producing innumerable similar machines without God’s further attention. If a man could manufacture such a set of machines that could produce other machines without his attention, then he could approach the intelligence of God.

Wherever one turns his face, he sees sex life predominant. Therefore, sex life is not unreal. Its reality is experienced in the spiritual world. The material sex life is but a perverted reflection of the original fact. The original fact is in the Absolute Truth, and thus the Absolute Truth cannot be impersonal. It is not possible to be impersonal and contain pure sex life. Consequently, the impersonalist philosophers have given indirect impetus to the abominable mundane sex life because they have overstressed the impersonality of the ultimate truth. Consequently, man without information of the actual spiritual form of sex has accepted perverted material sex life as the all in all. There is a distinction between sex life in the diseased material condition and spiritual sex life."

But if such material gains are obtainable in other ways, then so-called religion is neglected. This is the situation in modern civilization. Man is thriving economically, so at present he is not very interested in religion. Churches, mosques or temples are now practically vacant. Men are more interested in factories, shops, and cinemas than in religious places which were erected by their forefathers. This practically proves that religion is performed for some economic gains. Economic gains are needed for sense gratification. Often when one is baffled in the pursuit of sense gratification, he takes to salvation and tries to become one with the Supreme Lord.

In the material world there is keen competition between animal and animal, man and man, community and community, nation and nation. But the devotees of the Lord rise above such competitions. They do not compete with the materialist because they are on the path back to Godhead where life is eternal and blissful. Such transcendentalists are nonenvious and pure in heart. In the material world, everyone is envious of everyone else, and therefore there is competition. But the transcendental devotees of the Lord are not only free from material envy, but are well-wishers to everyone, and they strive to establish a competitionless society with God in the center. The contemporary socialist’s conception of a competitionless society is artificial because in the socialist state there is competition for the post of dictator. From the point of view of the <i>Vedas</i> or from the point of view of common human activities, sense gratification is the basis of material life. There are three paths mentioned in the <i>Vedas.</i> One involves fruitive activities to gain promotion to better planets. Another involves worshiping different demigods for promotion to the planets of the demigods, and another involves realizing the Absolute Truth and His impersonal feature and becoming one with Him."

This conception is not contradictory. <i><a href=\"https://vedabase.io/en/library/sb/\">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</a></i> explicitly promulgates this simultaneously-one-and-different philosophy of the <i>Vedānta-sūtra,</i> which begins with the “<i>janmādy asya</i>” <i>sūtra.</i>This knowledge that the energy of the Lord is simultaneously one with and different from the Lord is an answer to the mental speculators’ attempt to establish the energy as the Absolute. When this knowledge is factually understood, one sees the conceptions of monism and dualism to be imperfect. Development of this transcendental consciousness grounded in the conception of simultaneously-one-and-different leads one immediately to the stage of freedom from the threefold miseries. The threefold miseries are (1) those miseries which arise from the mind and body, (2) those miseries inflicted by other living beings, and (3) those miseries arising from natural catastrophes over which one has no control. <i><a href=\"https://vedabase.io/en/library/sb/\">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</a></i> begins with the surrender of the devotee unto the Absolute Person. The devotee is fully aware that he is one with the Absolute and at the same time in the eternal position of servant to the Absolute. In the material conception, one falsely thinks himself the lord of all he surveys, and therefore he is always troubled by the threefold miseries of life. But as soon as one comes to know his real position as transcendental servant, he at once becomes free from all miseries. As long as the living entity is trying to master material nature, there is no possibility of his becoming servant of the Supreme. Service to the Lord is rendered in pure consciousness of one’s spiritual identity; by service one is immediately freed from material encumbrances."

It was written in the maturity of his spiritual life through the mercy of Nārada. Śrī Vyāsadeva is the authorized incarnation of Nārāyaṇa, the Personality of Godhead. Therefore, there is no question as to his authority.

But in the <i><a href=\"https://vedabase.io/en/library/sb/\">Bhāgavatam</a></i> only the Supreme Lord is mentioned. The Supreme Lord is the total body, and the demigods are the different parts of that body. Consequently, by worshiping the Supreme Lord, one does not need to worship the demigods.

These sensual pleasures are technically called <i>rasas.</i> Such <i>rasas</i> are of different varieties. In the revealed scriptures the following twelve varieties of <i>rasas</i> are enumerated: (1) <i>raudra</i> (anger), (2) <i>adbhuta</i> (wonder), (3) <i>śṛṅgāra</i> (conjugal love), (4) <i>hāsya</i> (comedy), (5) <i>vīra</i> (chivalry), (6) <i>dayā</i> (mercy), (7) <i>dāsya</i> (servitorship), (8) <i>sakhya</i> (fraternity), (9) <i>bhayānaka</i> (horror), (10) <i>bībhatsa</i> (shock), (11) <i>śānta</i> (neutrality), (12) <i>vātsalya</i> (parenthood).The sum total of all these <i>rasas</i> is called affection or love. Primarily, such signs of love are manifested in adoration, service, friendship, parental affection, and conjugal love. And when these five are absent, love is present indirectly in anger, wonder, comedy, chivalry, fear, shock and so on. For example, when a man is in love with a woman, the <i>rasa</i> is called conjugal love. But when such love affairs are disturbed there may be wonder, anger, shock, or even horror. Sometimes love affairs between two persons culminate in ghastly murder scenes. Such <i>rasas</i> are displayed between man and man and between animal and animal. There is no possibility of an exchange or <i>rasa</i> between a man and an animal or between a man and any other species of living beings within the material world. The <i>rasas</i> are exchanged between members of the same species. But as far as the spirit souls are concerned, they are one qualitatively with the Supreme Lord. Therefore, the <i>rasas</i> were originally exchanged between the spiritual living being and the spiritual whole, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The spiritual exchange or <i>rasa</i> is fully exhibited in spiritual existence between living beings and the Supreme Lord.The Supreme Personality of Godhead is therefore described in the <i>śruti-mantras,</i> Vedic hymns, as “the fountainhead of all <i>rasas.</i>” When one associates with the Supreme Lord and exchanges one’s constitutional <i>rasa</i> with the Lord, then the living being is actually happy.These <i>śruti-mantras</i> indicate that every living being has its constitutional position, which is endowed with a particular type of <i>rasa</i> to be exchanged with the Personality of Godhead. In the liberated condition only, this primary <i>rasa</i> is experienced in full. In the material existence, the <i>rasa</i> is experienced in the perverted form, which is temporary. And thus the <i>rasas</i> of the material world are exhibited in the material form of <i>raudra</i> (anger) and so on.Therefore, one who attains full knowledge of these different <i>rasas,</i> which are the basic principles of activities, can understand the false representations of the original <i>rasas</i> which are reflected in the material world. The learned scholar seeks to relish the real <i>rasa</i> in the spiritual form. In the beginning he desires to become one with the Supreme. Thus, less intelligent transcendentalists cannot go beyond this conception of becoming one with the spirit whole, without knowing of the different <i>rasas.</i>"

                            "_text": "In Sanskrit the parrot is also known as <i>śuka.</i> When a ripened fruit is cut by the red beaks of such birds, its sweet flavor is enhanced. The Vedic fruit which is mature and ripe in knowledge is spoken through the lips of Śrīla Śukadeva Gosvāmī, who is compared to the parrot not for his ability to recite the <i><a href=\"https://vedabase.io/en/library/sb/\">Bhāgavatam</a></i> exactly as he heard it from his learned father, but for his ability to present the work in a manner that would appeal to all classes of men.The subject matter is so presented through the lips of Śrīla Śukadeva Gosvāmī that any sincere listener that hears submissively can at once relish transcendental tastes which are distinct from the perverted tastes of the material world. The ripened fruit is not dropped all of a sudden from the highest planet of Kṛṣṇaloka. Rather, it has come down carefully through the chain of disciplic succession without change or disturbance. Foolish people who are not in the transcendental disciplic succession commit great blunders by trying to understand the highest transcendental <i>rasa</i> known as the <i>rāsa</i> dance without following in the footsteps of Śukadeva Gosvāmī, who presents this fruit very carefully by stages of transcendental realization. One should be intelligent enough to know the position of <i><a href=\"https://vedabase.io/en/library/sb/\">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</a></i> by considering personalities like Śukadeva Gosvāmī, who deals with the subject so carefully. This process of disciplic succession of the <i>Bhāgavata</i> school suggests that in the future also <i><a href=\"https://vedabase.io/en/library/sb/\">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</a></i> has to be understood from a person who is factually a representative of Śrīla Śukadeva Gosvāmī. A professional man who makes a business out of reciting the <i><a href=\"https://vedabase.io/en/library/sb/\">Bhāgavatam</a></i> illegally is certainly not a representative of Śukadeva Gosvāmī. Such a man’s business is only to earn his livelihood. Therefore one should refrain from hearing the lectures of such professional men. Such men usually go to the most confidential part of the literature without undergoing the gradual process of understanding this grave subject. They usually plunge into the subject matter of the <i>rāsa</i> dance, which is misunderstood by the foolish class of men. Some of them take this to be immoral, while others try to cover it up by their own stupid interpretations. They have no desire to follow in the footsteps of Śrīla Śukadeva Gosvāmī.One should conclude, therefore, that the serious student of the <i>rasa</i> should receive the message of <i><a href=\"https://vedabase.io/en/library/sb/\">Bhāgavatam</a></i> in the chain of disciplic succession from Śrīla Śukadeva Gosvāmī, who describes the <i><a href=\"https://vedabase.io/en/library/sb/\">Bhāgavatam</a></i> from its very beginning and not whimsically to satisfy the mundaner who has very little knowledge in transcendental science. <i><a href=\"https://vedabase.io/en/library/sb/\">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</a></i> is so carefully presented that a sincere and serious person can at once enjoy the ripened fruit of Vedic knowledge simply by drinking the nectarean juice through the mouth of Śukadeva Gosvāmī or his bona fide representative."

However, the sages know it well, and therefore for the good of all men they are always anxious to perform acts which may bring about peace in the world. They are sincere friends to all living entities, and at the risk of great personal inconvenience they are always engaged in the service of the Lord for the good of all people. Lord Viṣṇu is just like a great tree, and all others, including the demigods, men, Siddhas, Cāraṇas, Vidyādharas and other living entities, are like branches, twigs and leaves of that tree. By pouring water on the root of the tree, all the parts of the tree are automatically nourished. Only those branches and leaves which are detached cannot be so satisfied. Detached branches and leaves dry up gradually despite all watering attempts. Similarly, human society, when it is detached from the Personality of Godhead like detached branches and leaves, is not capable of being watered, and one attempting to do so is simply wasting his energy and resources. The modern materialistic society is detached from its relation to the Supreme Lord. And all its plans which are being made by atheistic leaders are sure to be baffled at every step.

Only by his satisfaction can one please the Personality of Godhead, and when he is dissatisfied there is only havoc on the path of spiritual realization.” It is essential, therefore, that a disciple be very much obedient and submissive to the bona fide spiritual master. Śrīla Sūta Gosvāmī fulfilled all these qualifications as a disciple, and therefore he was endowed with all favors by his learned and self-realized spiritual masters such as Śrīla Vyāsadeva and others. The sages of Naimiṣāraṇya were confident that Śrīla Sūta Gosvāmī was bona fide. Therefore they were anxious to hear from him."

Their minds are always disturbed and full of anxieties due to so many different engagements. In this age, many unscrupulous men manufacture their own religious faiths which are not based on any revealed scriptures, and very often people who are addicted to sense gratification are attracted by such institutions. Consequently, in the name of religion so many sinful acts are being carried on that the people in general have neither peace of mind nor health of body. The student (<i>brahmacārī</i>) communities are no longer being maintained, and householders do not observe the rules and regulations of the <i>gṛhastha-āśrama.</i> Consequently, the so-called <i>vānaprasthas</i> and <i>sannyāsīs</i> who come out of such <i>gṛhastha-āśramas</i> are easily deviated from the rigid path. In the Kali-yuga the whole atmosphere is surcharged with faithlessness. Men are no longer interested in spiritual values. Material sense gratification is now the standard of civilization. For the maintenance of such material civilizations, man has formed complex nations and communities, and there is a constant strain of hot and cold wars between these different groups. It has become very difficult, therefore, to raise the spiritual standard due to the present distorted values of human society. The sages of Naimiṣāraṇya are anxious to disentangle all fallen souls, and here they are seeking the remedy from Śrīla Sūta Gosvāmī."

And so this age is very difficult for those who want to utilize this life for self-realization. The people are so busy with sense gratification that they completely forget about self-realization. Out of madness they frankly say that there is no need for self-realization because they do not realize that this brief life is but a moment on our great journey towards self-realization. The whole system of education is geared to sense gratification, and if a learned man thinks it over, he sees that the children of this age are being intentionally sent to the slaughterhouses of so-called education. Learned men, therefore, must be cautious of this age, and if they at all want to cross over the dangerous ocean of Kali, they must follow the footsteps of the sages of Naimiñäraëya and accept Çré Süta Gosvämé or his bona fide representative as the captain of the ship. The ship is the message of Lord Çré Kåñëa in the shape of Bhagavad-gétä or the Çrémad-Bhägavatam"
